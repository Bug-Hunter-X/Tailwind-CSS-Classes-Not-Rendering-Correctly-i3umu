# Tailwind CSS Class Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes may not render correctly in a React application.  The issue stems from incorrect or missing configuration.  The `bug.js` file shows the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution.

## Problem:

In `bug.js`, certain Tailwind classes, such as `space-x-2`, `bg-blue-500`, and `hover:bg-blue-700`, are not applied correctly, resulting in unexpected visual appearance of the buttons. 

## Solution:

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the fix.  Make sure that the Tailwind directives are correctly imported and configured in your project, such as adding `@tailwind base;` `@tailwind components;` `@tailwind utilities;` to your main CSS file (usually `globals.css`).
